        <h4>Welcome to the Dot Choice Experiment!</h4>
        <h5>Your assigned role is <strong>moderator</strong></h5>
        
        <p>You will be participating in a study where you act as a <strong>moderator</strong> overseeing other participants' performance in a dot-counting task. Here's how it works:</p>

        <h5>The Task:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>You will see a display of dots for <strong>{{ display_seconds }}</strong> seconds.</li>
            <li>The dots will be divided into left and right sides by a diagonal line.</li>
            <li>Another participant will make a choice about which side has more dots.</li>
            <li>As the moderator, your role is to decide whether to issue a warning or a penalty when mistakes are made.</li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Important Details:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>The participant you're moderating receives <strong>{{ preferred_side_points }}</strong> bonus points for choosing the <strong>{{ preferred_side }}</strong> side.</li>
            <li>When they make an incorrect choice, you can:
                <ul>
                    <li>Issue a warning (no point deduction)</li>
                    <li>Issue a penalty (reducing their points by <strong>{{ fine_amount }}</strong> points)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>You'll moderate <strong>{{ num_rounds }} rounds</strong> in total.</li>
        </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Your decisions directly impact the other participant's final score</li>
                    <li>You'll observe their choice after each round</li>
                    <li>You must decide whether to warn or penalize them when they make mistakes</li>
                    <li>Consider both accuracy and their potential strategy when making your decisions</li>
